narcolepsy
==========

Sleep soundly. Sleep randomly.


Overview
--------

The ``narcolepsy`` package contains code which alters the behavior of your
application/api by injecting random sleep calls into decorated functions.


Usage
-----

The following code is an example of using the ``@narcoleptic`` decorator.

::

    from narcolepsy import narcoleptic

    @narcoleptic(max=5)  # sleep for 5 seconds at max
    def foobar():
        for x in xrange(1024):
            nested_function(x)
            
The ``@narcoleptic`` decorator takes three parameters (all optional):

*  ``min``: The minimum sleep time in seconds.
*  ``max``: The maximum sleep time in seconds.
*  ``chance``: The maximum number of lines that will be executed before a ``sleep()`` 
   call is injected.

If no ``min`` or ``max`` are passed in, the constants defined in 
``narcolepsy.constants`` will be used instead.
If no ``chance`` is passed in, a value will be derived from the number of lines 
in the input function.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install ``narcolepsy`` is via ``pip``:

::

    $ pip install narcolepsy


Why?
----

Just for funsies.There are probably testing applications that I haven't
considered where timing is an integral component to the execution environment. 
Or you could use this to make sneaking by CAPTCHAs a bit easier :D
